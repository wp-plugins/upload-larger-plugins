Install plugins of any size (i.e. work around web hosting limits)

== Description ==

This plugin replaces the built-in WordPress plugin uploader with one that allow you to upload a plugin of any size.

This is something you might need if your web hosting has a low maximum file upload limit (some default PHP installs have 2Mb), and the plugin you wish to install is too large for this.

It accomplishes this task by replacing WordPress's default plugin uploader with a more sophisticated component that can upload larger files in chunks.

== Installation ==

Standard WordPress plugin installation:

2. Click 'Install'

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the configuration settings? =

There are none. If the plugin is active, then it will replace the upload widget on the Plugins -> Upload configuration page in your WordPress dashboard. That is all.

= Does this plugin also enable the upload of larger themes? =

No. It would not be a huge job to extend it to do so; but I have no reasons for doing that presently.
